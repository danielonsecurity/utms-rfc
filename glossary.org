** UTMS
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4c9385b7-e30f-4aa3-ba4f-ed9800fb20d1
:END:
Universal Time Measurement/Management System — a programmable,
extensible, and multi-layered time framework supporting multiple
representations, computations, and human+machine interoperability.

** Meta-Time
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1a530e2b-b574-4491-a300-f1fcbba482b2
:END:
An abstraction layer that encompasses and connects all definitions and
representations of time (physical, perceptual, cultural,
computational) into a coherent, hierarchical system.

** Layer
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       076ec95d-85bf-4804-a1fd-cbe35e3af892
:END:
A self-contained stratum of functionality or abstraction within the
UTMS time stack. Inspired by the TCP/IP model. Layers pass data
("PDUs") between each other.

** PDU
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       1b8d5e04-5352-426c-9e2b-2be554022b09
:END:
Protocol Data Unit — A time element (timestamp, range, uncertainty,
etc.) that is structured and passed through UTMS layers. PDUs are
composed of layered fields, like network packets.

** TDU
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       42f5e2dc-12f0-4257-9506-5447dee246d1
:END:
Time Data Unit — The core abstraction unit at each layer (e.g., binary
delta at Physical layer, entropy sequence at Info layer, etc.)

** RFC
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e1a1f45a-bf3e-43e7-b7f9-d67c47e81023
:END:
Request for Comments — A formal specification document that defines a
UTMS component, protocol, format, or philosophical
principle. Immutable once published.

** Hy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       63e6c14c-3cc8-4339-958f-3f03f0eb07dc
:END:
A Lisp dialect that compiles to Python AST. Used in UTMS for defining
units, anchors, transformations, and configuration in code-as-data
style.

** Anchor
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fb6e6b7a-ad66-4304-a8e8-ff8ea4f05c6e
:END:
A fixed or dynamic point in time from which other time values can be
derived or measured. e.g., Now, Unix Epoch, Big Bang.

** Formatter
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       297e84a8-f9bb-4674-be3a-1995c5c8540e
:END:
A component that renders internal time representations into human- or
machine-readable forms (scientific, calendar, unit-based, etc.).

** Time Stack
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5473000c-7b74-4728-a9ec-3ac4a8ca973f
:END:
The conceptual model of layered abstractions in UTMS — e.g., Physical,
Informational, Representational, Semantic, Application.

** Interpretability
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       af334bc7-76fc-4218-9d7a-b382a3652be9
:END:
The ability to transform and view time elements in alternative but
meaningful formats (e.g., entropy, uncertainty, language, coordinate
offset).

** Extensibility
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8d6a9715-bffe-4c44-ae0f-f65c3c9d508d
:END:
The system’s ability to be enhanced by user-defined units,
transformations, anchors, and semantic mappings without modifying the
core.

** Code-as-Data
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       08fc9b6d-1fe4-475f-8df6-0366d2817f08
:END:
A design principle where time constructs (e.g., anchors, units) are
written in Hy and treated as both executable code and configuration
data.
