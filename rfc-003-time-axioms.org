#+ABSTRACT: Defines a minimal symbolic and axiomatic foundation for time, grounded in physical reality and model-agnostic compatibility.


* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8dba509e-5c43-4217-8096-d65514541b2a
:END:
This RFC defines a scientifically rigorous symbolic and axiomatic
foundation for time, independent of UTMS. It introduces the smallest
possible set of universally accepted axioms that any physical theory
of time must satisfy. This foundation is designed to allow maximal
freedom for modeling different theories of time (block universe,
temporal branching, causal loops, etc.) without bias. It is intended
to enable both human and AI reasoning about time with minimal
ontological commitment.

This RFC uses standard symbols from first-order predicate logic:

| Symbol | Meaning                               |
|--------+---------------------------------------|
| ∀      | Universal quantifier                  |

Function application follows standard mathematical notation:
- `f(x)` is the result of applying function `f` to argument `x`
- Multiple arguments are comma-separated: `Δ(e₁, e₂)`
- Nested applications are allowed: `f(g(x))`


* Terminology
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8a3c3d7d-9f8a-4aed-bae7-90d90ae4ed1c
:END:
** Event (e)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6785dfaa-2137-4471-8f4d-0b5e806cd9b4
:END:
An event is a discrete occurrence in time, representing a moment or
action that can be mapped to a specific time point. It is the most
basic unit in a temporal model.

** Time Point (τ)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0ad45f26-1b7a-4c3a-9f4a-140376b934ab
:END:
A time point represents a specific instant in time. It is an
abstraction used to denote the occurrence of an event or the position
of an anchor in time.

** Time Duration (Δ)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ee6adab0-1a9b-4158-bae5-acfe8d1ccbe6
:END:
The duration represents the time difference between two time points or
events. It is always a non-negative value, describing how long
something lasts between two temporal moments.

** Time Range (τ₁, τ₂)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b9d2b17e-1ece-45bf-9e48-f49acba0a438
:END:
A time range is a continuous interval between two time points (τ₁ and
τ₂). This range is defined by its starting and ending time points,
representing a segment of time.

** Time Anchor (𝒜)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c50395f9-369e-499e-af89-07e01060a405
:END:
A time anchor is a reference point in time that helps define relative
times. Anchors are used as fixed markers in the temporal framework,
against which other time-related events or ranges are measured.

** Temporal Function (f)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ea1289cc-b34e-4611-9a76-ada64cfa03e7
:END:
A temporal function is a mathematical function that maps events to
time points or other time-related values. It can be used to model
relationships between events, such as precedence or causality.

** Precedence (≺)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       22d45efe-c9e2-4aee-ab49-1c7355f29ce9
:END:
Precedence is a temporal relation where one event occurs before
another event. This relation is transitive, meaning that if *e₁ ≺
e₂* and *e₂ ≺ e₃*, then *e₁ ≺ e₃*.

** Succession (≻)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c5b19785-112d-4749-a123-bf8dac655d39
:END:
Succession denotes the temporal relation where one event occurs after
another event. This relation is transitive, meaning that if *e₁ ≻
e₂* and *e₂ ≻ e₃*, then *e₁ ≻ e₃*.

** Causality (→)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fc7ab533-4ebe-4040-a67b-1ead1d25bdbe
:END:
Causality denotes the relationship where one event (the cause) leads
to another event (the effect). This relation models the
cause-and-effect chains that govern the sequence of events in time.

** Reverse Causality (←)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b02537ad-ce51-4c40-8133-d4aea55cb5d8
:END:
Reverse causality denotes the relationship where the effect leads to
the cause. This relation represents cases where an event causes
another event to occur in reverse order.

** Equivalence (≡)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       c1ab7c2e-24f0-4a01-a1b0-55dafc28477b
:END:
Equivalence is used to express the idea that two time-related
expressions are equal or represent the same event or time point. This
is a way of establishing logical equivalence in temporal models.

** Non-Equivalence (≠)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a79754ed-6ec5-4618-b7e9-0a64081c79c5
:END:
Non-equivalence denotes the relationship where two time-related
expressions are not equal, i.e., they represent different events or
time points.

* Axioms
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5255d458-3a33-49f9-83ca-4fd2f785a25b
:END:
** Axiom 1: Temporal Order Exists
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       25c7869a-a2c8-4e59-8c43-69fa8fe15bbc
:END:
Time allows ordering of events.

∀ e₁, e₂ ∈ 𝓔: (e₁ ≺ e₂) ∨ (e₂ ≺ e₁) ∨ (e₁ ≡ e₂)

This axiom states that for any pair of events, one precedes the other
or they are temporally equivalent.

Causality implies temporal order.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∀ e₁, e₂ ∈ 𝓔: (e₁ → e₂) → ∃ τ₁, τ₂ ∈ τ: (τ₁ ≺ τ₂ ∧ e₁(τ₁) ∧ e₂(τ₂))
#+END_SRC
If one event causes another, the cause must precede the effect in time.

:PROPERTIES:

#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∀ e₁, e₂ ∈ 𝓔: (e₁ ≡ e₂) ⇔ (e₂ ≡ e₁)
#+END_SRC

** Axiom 8: Independence of Non-Causal Events
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e882b759-32bb-4c4b-b742-fdf9bcdd3374
:END:
Events not causally linked are temporally independent.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∀ e₁, e₂ ∈ 𝓔: ¬(e₁ → e₂) ∧ ¬(e₂ → e₁) → e₁ ⫫ e₂
#+END_SRC

** Axiom 9: Anchors Exist
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       b10b289e-74f0-41c1-ac8d-c803c6e87d2f
:END:
There exist time points that serve as referential markers.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∃ α ∈ τ: ∀ e ∈ 𝓔: anchor(e) = α ⇔ (e occurs relative to α)
#+END_SRC

** Axiom 10: Event Locality
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       e70f179b-e245-4949-9f8b-8be951f56ac5
:END:

** Axiom 11: Continuity (optional)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       93c961d4-f27e-4b24-a9e2-9dc7bd42adf2
:END:
Between any two time points, there exists another.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∀ τ₁, τ₂ ∈ τ: (τ₁ ≺ τ₂) → ∃ τₓ ∈ τ: (τ₁ ≺ τₓ ≺ τ₂)
#+END_SRC
(This assumes a dense or continuous time axis, but could be weakened or excluded depending on whether discrete-time models should be allowed.)

** Axiom 12: Time is Unidirectional
:PROPERTIES:

#+END_SRC

** Axiom 13: Temporal Consistency
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6505a094-3c5d-4443-9d6c-058e2c413ca8
:END:
No contradiction in ordering can exist.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex

** Axiom 14: Minimal Assumption Principle
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5074bcfb-3db1-4575-8be1-a8fa2d75e016
:END:
If a time structure allows multiple consistent interpretations, none is favored axiomatically.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
¬ ∃ axiom A: (A excludes valid physical interpretation consistent with all above axioms)
#+END_SRC
(This is a meta-axiom: it restricts the system to avoid unnecessary assumptions.)

** Axiom 15: Time-Agnostic Modeling of State Superposition
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       2d06923d-f117-4de4-9623-2695369f0e30
:END:
Temporal models must permit representation of non-temporal state multiplicity (e.g., quantum superposition), without violating core time structure.
#+BEGIN_SRC latex
∃ e ∈ 𝓔: (e(τ) = {s₁, s₂, ..., sₙ}) ∧ ∀ sᵢ ≠ sⱼ: (e collapses to one sₖ upon measurement)
#+END_SRC

** Axiom 16: Compatibility with Observed Physics
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6fe02ac1-d738-4a75-92f6-9ca7dc103710
