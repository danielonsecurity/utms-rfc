#+ABSTRACT: Defines the foundational time model, layer stack, terminology, and principles of UTMS.

* Introduction
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       0bb2ca91-26df-4f88-9f31-4d981e731432
:END:
This RFC defines the foundational design philosophy of the Universal
Time Measurement System (UTMS), including its first-class principles,
second-class principles, and its layered architecture. It serves as
the root reference for all subsequent RFCs.

All future RFCs build on this structure.

* First-Class Principles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       bad63ef3-923b-44c6-80a3-ad4b4c3ffd50
:END:
These principles are *non-negotiable*, and all UTMS layers, definitions, formats, and extensions must comply with them.


** UNIVERSALITY
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       6ae17e5b-2cee-43eb-af1b-03df89dfae61
:END:
UTMS must support a truly universal understanding and manipulation of
time. This encompasses all time scales—sub-Planck to cosmic, discrete
to continuous—and operates across all domains (scientific, symbolic,
and experiential).


** MODULARITY
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       64d4fbeb-04d4-441c-9966-3956931b1305
:END:
UTMS components must be completely modular, allowing independent
layers to operate and evolve without interdependencies. Modules should
be swappable, extendable, and compatible with the system’s expanding
capabilities, including AI-driven enhancements.


** EXTENSIBILITY
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       f6a8237c-d08a-4526-9d20-14ceface0443
:END:
UTMS must be inherently extensible at every level, from time units and
anchors to AI-enhanced time interpretation. New logic, formats,
plugins, and analysis tools must be easily added or customized without
modifying the core system.


** CODE-AS-DATA
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       114049a6-4062-464e-8042-ebf52507e6f4
:END:
All UTMS constructs must be expressible as Hy code and data. This
means both declarative representations (via macros, Hy-based data) and
the ability to perform dynamic computation. Code and data must be
deeply integrated to allow for on-the-fly code generation, analysis,
and AI-driven metaprogramming.


** INTROSPECTABILITY
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       878ffe91-fe6f-4562-95a4-b0b2534d3727
:END:
Every UTMS data object must be introspectable, capable of revealing
its structure, history, and metadata. Beyond just human-readable
formats, introspection must also facilitate AI-driven
analysis—allowing the system to not only reflect on time data but also
offer insights, predictions, and recommendations based on temporal
patterns.

* Second-Class Principles
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a233d109-dc85-4168-baf1-b16125852e3a
:END:

** Consistency of representation
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       780e890d-801e-4442-a06c-79b6b45c5708
:END:
Time data should be represented consistently across all layers, with
clear definitions of units, anchors, and formats.

** Predictability of Behavior
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       62c0de6a-3a25-4654-bbd9-a81a0e3350bd
:END:
UTMS must maintain predictability in its operations, especially when
interacting with complex AI systems or user extensions.

** Separation of Concerns
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       11556a4d-d677-4c83-bbff-080a31f333b0
:END:
Different layers in UTMS should address distinct responsibilities,
with clear boundaries between representation, computation, AI
analysis, and user interaction.

** Reusability and Generalization
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       981008b3-2ce8-480c-bdb7-be090212c614
:END:
Code, components, and algorithms should be designed with reusability
and generality in mind, enabling the creation of tools and solutions
that can serve multiple use cases.

** Dynamic interactivity
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       58afd361-fe3c-4f90-8099-6175bff1e17d
:END:
UTMS should enable dynamic interaction with time-related data,
including AI-based insights, format changes, and on-the-fly
adjustments based on user or system-driven input.

** Minimal intrusiveness of AI
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       5394e60b-27b2-4ae7-b8d4-40a3388ea343
:END:
AI should operate in a supportive role, augmenting user experience and
analysis without overshadowing the core system or disrupting user
expectations.

** Scalability of data handling
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       a855dc5b-5dee-438e-ba3c-5d3b5eb39bf2
:END:
UTMS must handle a vast range of time-related data without performance
degradation, ensuring that the system scales well across both small
and large time spans and diverse domains.

** Transparency of AI-Driven decisions
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       4d50c9e9-c266-4be4-9a77-6cda3a98f9e2
:END:
AI analysis, recommendations, and predictions must be transparent,
providing clear explanations about how conclusions are drawn and what
data was used.

** Data Integrity and safety
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       d01ee293-e2ae-402d-977e-207bc4a64a60
:END:
UTMS should ensure the integrity of time data, preventing data loss,
corruption, or inconsistent states across different layers, especially
as AI or external systems interact with the data.

** Human centric design
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       fb2d7c5a-3f5f-4d4b-9801-a0aa4e9079e9
:END:
UTMS should be designed with a focus on user interaction and
user-friendly insights, making advanced temporal analysis accessible
and actionable for humans, regardless of technical background.

** Security and privacy
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       eb9e592d-0667-4d39-86e5-10b7e8efd6f6
:END:
Time data within UTMS should be handled securely, ensuring that user
data, especially when extended or analyzed by AI, remains private and
protected.

** Cross-domain compatibility
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       606ba869-d463-4e02-b9f0-f6da8d452fd2
:END:
UTMS must be compatible across different domains (scientific,
business, social, etc.) with customizable layers that adapt to the
domain-specific needs and time representations.

* Layered Meta-Time Model
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ee10bfd4-4c7d-45d4-9a21-2fdc13400221
:END:

Inspired by the TCP/IP model, UTMS is organized into a stack of five conceptual layers:

| Layer | Name             | Purpose                                                    |
|-------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| L1    | Physical Layer    | Encodes base time deltas, raw temporal measurement units   |
| L2    | Informational     | Adds entropy, uncertainty, or symbolic complexity          |
| L3    | Representational  | Maps to human-readable formats (calendar, scientific)      |
| L4    | Semantic          | Associates meaning: “birthday”, “event start”, etc.        |
| L5    | Application       | Ties time data into application logic, workflows, APIs     |

Each Protocol Data Unit (PDU) includes nested components from each layer. Data is passed top-down and bottom-up.

* Protocol Data Unit (PDU) Structure
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       8fdd8fe8-7421-4954-a5c4-fe723772f945
:END:

A UTMS PDU is a composite structure representing a time element as it moves through the stack.

** Required Fields (by layer)
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       340a1c19-8a6c-4d10-836a-3c80033d89f0
:END:
- Physical: delta (seconds), unit (e.g., "s"), origin (e.g., "anchor-id")
- Informational: uncertainty, entropy
- Representational: format type, rendered output
- Semantic: tag, context
- Application: function binding, user-defined metadata

** Optional Fields
:PROPERTIES:
:ID:       ce48afc1-eb29-4a2b-beb4-c7fae70857d0
:END:
Each layer may extend the PDU structure with additional keys.
